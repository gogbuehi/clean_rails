CLEAN RAILS Vagrant Box
=======================

This is a simple repository for creating a simple rails app.

Requirements
------------
 - VirtualBox
 - Vagrant

Command-line steps:
-------------------
 1. Clone this repository and navigate to the directory
 2. Run `vagrant up`
 3. Run `vagrant ssh`
 4.     `cd /vagrant`
 5.     `gem install rails`
 6.     `rails new .`

Start Rails without a DB
---------------------
 - Remove database adapter gems from your Gemfile (mysql2, sqlite3, etc.)
 - Change your config/application.rb in the following way:
   * Remove require 'rails/all line and require frameworks you want to use, for example:

     * require "action_controller/railtie"
     * require "action_mailer/railtie"
     * require "sprockets/railtie"
     * require "rails/test_unit/railtie"

   * Note: I put these 4 in mine; Got the solution from here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19078044/disable-activerecord-for-rails-4 (Step 1 and 2 were all I needed)

Starting Rails
--------------
Use the following command within the virtual machine in `/vagrant/`:
 - `rails s -b 0.0.0.0 -p 3001`

Go to the following URL in a browser:
 - http://localhost:4513/
